# Ask Shaqra App
This app provides university emails to the doctors of Shaqra University to help students reach them and communicate with them in a quick way.
## The Idea
I searched for the most important problems facing the students of Shaqra university, especially the new students, and I found one of the most important problems is the difficulty of knowing the university email of the doctor and accessing it. Therefore, I created the Ask Shaqra App, which is a bot that helps students access doctors emails without fatigue and effort.
## Resources
Search and collect university emails of Shaqra University doctors.

## Future Development
There are many features that I would like to add to the Ask Shaqra App:

• Availability of Arabic language.

• More university emails for Shaqra University doctors. 

• Expanding the scope to include all branches of Shaqra University.
